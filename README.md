# Orbis-Challenge-2016

This is AI for the game "Cyber Team Zero" for the Orbis Challenge.
My AI ranked 9th out of 50 or so teams competing.

You can look at the source code where I explain in the comments my strategy.

If you want to see my AI in action, go to the "Cyber Team Zero" folder and run one of the executables called "launcher".
A window should pop up. Here you will have the option of choosing some game parameters and the AI to play the game. 
When selecting AI just choose the source code (either python or java). Then click start to view the game.

My AI is located directly in the src folder. I have also included AI's of other people from the competition which should be
located in "src\other peoples AIs". I'd recommend playing my AI against arock's. His AI is actually stronger than mine, but his unfortunately
times out if not given enough time.

More details on rules, and how to start a game can be found in the game manual, which is located in folder "Cyber Team Zero\ Manual"
